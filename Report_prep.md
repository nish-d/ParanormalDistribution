## Step 1: EDA, cleaning, encoding, normalizing

| Feature              | Findings                                                     | Cleaning step                                                | Treatment/Encoding                                           | Normalization           | Justification                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| listing_id           | Just an identifier                                           |                                                              | Drop the column                                              |                         | ID column                                                    |
| title                | Title of listing                                             |                                                              | Drop the column                                              |                         | All information here is also present in other columns        |
| address              | Address format varies. In some places it is block number followed by street (`7 fernvale close`), in some places just the street (`cashew road`), and sometimes just the district (`sembawang / yishun (d27)`). |                                                              | Drop the column.                                             |                         | We felt we could do better with the location afforded  by lat/long and subzone, which are consistent, specific, and granular enough. |
| property_name        | Name of the condo or HDB.                                    |                                                              | Target encode to average per sq. ft. price for the property in our database. | Standard normalization  | This is the most granular level of location detail we have. Apartments in a particular Condo/HDB should have very similar per sq.ft. prices given the same location amenities etc. Therefore, we are target encoding this. TODO: What to do when a query has a property name not present in our training set? |
| property_type        |                                                              | Everything to lower caps. Convert all `hdb n rooms` values to just `hdb`. | One hot encode the resulting set of possible property types. |                         | Property type is an important distinction for both recommendation and predicting the price of a new property. Since the category cardinality is small, we go with one hot encoding for this field. |
| tenure               | Some values are empty. Most of the values are close to either 99 year lease, 1000 year lease, or are freehold. | Approximate and reduce to three categories - `99-year lease`, `999-year lease`, and `freehold`. Try to fill `null` values by copying value from the same property name. | Drop records with null even after cleaning. One hot encode the three resulting catgories. |                         | Small cardinality plus an important value to determine prices, so one-hot makes sense. Approximating makes sense since a 94 year lease won't be very different from a 102 year lease for a buyer. |
| built_year           | Some empty values                                            | Try to fill `null` values by copying value from the same property name. | Drop records with null values. Encode rest as it is.         | Standard normalization  | Keeping built year                                           |
| num_beds             | Some empty values                                            |                                                              | Drop records with empty values. Encode as it is.             |                         | Number of bedrooms is an important attribute to determining price, so it makes sense to drop record if value not available. Small value so no need to normalize. |
| num_baths            | Some empty values                                            |                                                              | Drop records with empty values. Encode as it is.             |                         | Number of bathrooms is an important attribute to determining price, so it makes sense to drop record if value not available.  Small value so no need to normalize. |
| size_sqft            | One listing id had `0` size.                                 |                                                              | Drop the <=0 values.                                         | Standard normalization  | Area can be a large number, so normalizing to a value between 0 and 1 makes sense. |
| floor_level          | Too many missing values, with values missing across categories. |                                                              | Drop the column.                                             |                         | Not possible to fill the missing values up reasonably.       |
| furnishing           | 10 `na` values. 14K records of `unspecified` values.         | Remove records with `na` values.                             | One hot encode the furnishing value.                         |                         | Furnishing level can make a difference to the price of a property. Even though many values are unspecified, we keep this column and one hot encode it to capture the information here. |
| available_unit_types | Missing values. No standard format.                          |                                                              | Drop the column.                                             |                         | This is the types of apartments available in the building. While this may indirectly indicate how *prime* a property is, we hope the target encoding on property name and location will capture that information better. |
| total_num_units      | Missing values.                                              |                                                              | Drop the column.                                             |                         | Same logic as above for `available_unit_types`               |
| property_details_url | Just a URL for the listing.                                  |                                                              | Drop the column.                                             |                         |                                                              |
| lat                  | Some values outside singapore                                |                                                              | Drop records with invalid (outside SG) values.               |                         |                                                              |
| long                 | Some values outside singapore.                               |                                                              | Drop records with invalid (outside SG) values.               |                         |                                                              |
| elevation            | 0 for all values                                             |                                                              | Drop the column                                              |                         |                                                              |
| subzone              | Some missing values.                                         | Try to fill `null` values by copying value from the same property name. | Drop records with null even after cleaning. Target encode to average price per sq. ft. for the subzone. | Standard normalization. | Subzone is critical location data which could tell us how *prime* a location is. |
| planning_area        | Some missing values.                                         |                                                              | Drop column.                                                 |                         | Subzone is a more granular location indicator, so relying on that to convey the impact of lcoation on property price. Within a planning_area there may be high variance of prices per sq ft, demand, etc. |
| price                |                                                              |                                                              | Encode as it is.                                             | Standard normalization. |                                                              |
